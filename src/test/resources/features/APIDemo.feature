Feature: Validation of get method

  @GetUserDetails
  Scenario Outline: Send a valid Request to get user details

    Given I send a request to the URL to get user details
    Then the response will return status <statusCode> and id <id> and email "<employee_email>" and first name "<employee_firstname>" and last name "<employee_lastname>"

    Examples:
    | statusCode | id  | employee_email          | employee_firstname | employee_lastname |
    | 200        | 2   | janet.weaver@reqres.in  | Janet              | Weaver            |
